refactorings:
- allow sims for different classes / specs. allow whole raid sim.

- on use
- bloodrage on cd vs. when no rage available for ability
- evtl. deep wounds
  - https://www.wowhead.com/forums&topic=144974
  - gets overwritten pretty soon: https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=19499
- execute weapon set


- improve log entries, aim for complete transparency:
  - flurry uptime
  - bt / ww: how many of the theoretically possible ones are done during a fight due to rage?


- difference 2x fast vs. slow / fast vs. slow / slow @ execute phase


x model buffs (own, other classes, consumables)
x model procs (items, talents, enchants)
talents: deep wounds
model on-use effects (items, consumables (mighty rage potion, juju flurry))
x model boss buffs / debuffs
x event queue
x ability comes off cd = event, end of gcd = event
x model rage, on_rage_gained callback
x model ability priorities
x run sim n times (use confidence interval to define n) on boss x, output dps, dps per ability, stat weights
are floats an issue? if yes, how to get around floating point arithmetics?
do i need to use epsilon anywhere else?
rounding: when to round / floor / ceil?
refactor debuffs (like buffs)
model debuffs only on boss after some time, cd stacking, ...
x fight duration: draw randomly around configured duration (from normal distribution? fixed min / max?)
save / load item sets

performance improvements (expecting a 2x speedup from optimizations times a 4x speedup on 4 logical cores):
- cache all calculations with fixed result
- current_stats: reduce calls to a minimum / calculate only in handle_event (?)
- reduce copy to a minimum
- make sure logging doesn't use any cpu time when disabled
- parallelize do_n_runs

abilities to model:
prio 1:
x bt
x ww
x bloodrage
x death wish
x recklessness
x hs

prio 2:
x execute
x op (less crit @ battle)

prio 3:
battle shout

tests / lookups:
does flurry proc from all attacks or only white hit / hs? did it change with bc?
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.11.0: Flurry: The tooltip for this talent has been adjusted to indicate it only works on normal melee swings.
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1: Fixed an issue where extra attacks from "Windfury Weapon" would not proc "Flurry" when they crit.
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0: Whirlwind: Critical strikes with the off-hand weapon from this ability can now trigger Flurry and Rampage.

reck gcd?
bt, ww cds
check calculated stats = stats in char window
white hit weapon damage actually randomly drawn in dmg range or just the average?
what about ww?

hoj, thrash blade mechanics.
can they really proc off everything (probably not, there was some kind of chain proc fix in 1.9)?
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=8131
works by resetting swing timer -> current implementation is too much damage for sure.
what happens to flurry charge on resetting? probably lost and not applied to the new swing.
bt not able to proc it since it doesn't require a weapon?
