gcd on stance change?
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0:
Stances: It is no longer possible to accidentally change into a stance you are already in via macros (resulting in a global cooldown and loss of rage).

proc:
wf
items

on use:
heroism
drums
haste potion
items

comparisons:
no op + anger management vs. op + no anger management
dw spec, imp exe, weapon mastery, precision, imp ww choice
rampage @ execute phase?

research:
is ww with both hands actually 2 attacks, 2 times damage dealt, 2 times chance to proc stuff etc.?
2.4 patch notes seem to indicate this: "Whirlwind: Critical strikes with the off-hand weapon from this ability can now trigger Flurry and Rampage."
